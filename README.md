 PROJECTS
 
 1) ROAD ACCIDENT DASHBOARD USING POWER BI | CHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY | MARCH 2024 | ROLE- TEAM LEADER FEBRURAY 2024
 
 DATA COLLECTION AND INTEGRATION: Collected data from Kaggle, CSV/Excel files.
 DATA TRANSFORMATION: Applied Power Query to handle missing data, filter out irrelevant records, and normalize datasets. Created
 custom columns and calculated fields using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for enhanced data insights.
 Geospatial Visualization: It can be used to plot accident locations and frequency to identify accident hotspots.
 DATA MODELING: Created relationships between multiple tables using Power BI’s model and used star schema for better performance
 and easier analysis, with dimension tables like "Accident Type," "Time," and "Location.
 TREND ANALYSIS: Used time series analysis to display accident trends over time (e.g., yearly, monthly, daily).
 RISK AND SEVERITY: Calculating accident severity scores based on injuries, fatalities, and property damage.
 KPI AND METRICS VISUALISATION: Track critical metrics such as total accidents, accidents by type, and severity distribution, and Create
 visually appealing charts like bar charts, pie charts, and stacked column charts to present accident data.
 USER-CENTRIC: Focused on a user-friendly dashboard layout, utilizing slicers, tooltips, and dynamic visualizations.
 
 2) SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS WITH NEURAL NETWORK | CHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY | OCTOBER 2024 OCTOBER 2024
 
 OBJECTIVE: The project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, classifying them as positive or negative using neural
 network techniques.
 TECHNIQUE AND TOOLS: 1) DATA PRE-PROCESSING: Removal of tags, punctuations, and stop words; text normalization using libraries
 like TensorFlow.
 2) MODELS: Simple Neural Network (SNN) Embedding, flattening, and dense layers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used
 primarily for image recognition. Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) for sequential data.
 SOLUTION PROCESS: 1) Using a dataset of 50,000 IMDb reviews.
 2) Tokenized reviews, padded sequences to a uniform length.
 3) Implemented three architectures SNN, CNN, and LSTM.
 4) Trained models on 80% of the data and validated the remaining 20%.
 ACCURACY: SNN: 85.7%, CNN: 86.2%, LSTM: 86.2%
 LSTM and CNN showed slightly better performance due to handling sequential dependencies and capturing local features, respectively.
 
 3) UBER DATA ANALYSIS USING R PROGRAMMING | CHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY | SEPTEMBER 2023 SEPTEMBER 2023
 
 OBJECTIVES: Analyze urban mobility patterns using Uber data from April to September 2023. Identify peak and off-peak hours, monthly
 trends, and average travel activity levels.
 TOOLS AND LIBRARIES: ggplot2, ggthemes, dplyr, tidyr, DT, scales.
 METHODS:
 1) Data Loading and Cleaning: Imported datasets for months April to September 2023. Combined datasets and converted date-time
 formats.
 2) Feature Engineering: Created new columns for hours and months. Grouped data by hour and month for summarization.
 3) Visualization: Bar plots created for hourly and monthly trip trends. Highlighted peak hours and monthly travel patterns.
 FINDINGS: Peak Hour: 6 PM (highest number of trips), Off-Peak Hour: 3 AM (lowest number of trips).
 MONTHLY TRENDS: Increasing trip numbers from April to July. Decrease from July to September.
 SEASONAL FACTORS: Weather, daylight, and human activity influence travel demand.
 INSIGHTS: The city exhibits a high level of dynamic travel demand with an average of 140,000 trips per hour.
